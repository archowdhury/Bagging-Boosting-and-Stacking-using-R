## This article demonstrates the use of Bagging, Boosting and Stacking models using the "caret" package in R

#### The sample data used is "Ionosphere" from the UCI Machine Learning repository

#### The first two sections demonstrate the use of Bagging and Boosting algorithms

#### The final section creates a stacked model to combine the following models using Random Forest to obtain an impressive accuracy of 93.9%!!!
##### 1) Decision Tree (CART)
##### 2) Logistic Regression
##### 3) K-Nearest Neighbors
##### 4) SVM using a Radial Basis
